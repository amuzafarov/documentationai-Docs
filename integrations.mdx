## Webhook Setup Guide

Set up webhooks to receive real-time events from Compitio. Follow these steps to configure a webhook endpoint on your server.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Webhook Endpoint" icon="server">
    Expose a public HTTPS endpoint on your server to receive POST requests from Compitio.

````javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  console.log('Event:', req.body);
  res.status(200).json({ received: true });
});

app.listen(3000);
````
  </Step>
  <Step title="Register Webhook" icon="plus">
    Use the Compitio dashboard to add your endpoint URL.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Events" icon="check-circle">
    Test the webhook and handle events like `user.created` or `task.completed`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Custom API Integrations

Build custom integrations using our REST API at `https://api.example.com/v1`. Authenticate requests with your API key in the `Authorization` header.

<ParamField header="Authorization" param-type="string" required="true">
  Bearer `{YOUR_API_KEY}`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="limit" param-type="integer" required="false">
  Number of results to return (default: 50, max: 100).
</ParamField>

Here is an example request to fetch integrations:

<Request tabs="JavaScript,cURL">
  ````javascript
  const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/v1/integrations', {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
    }
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(data);
  ````
  ````bash
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
       https://api.example.com/v1/integrations
  ````
</Request>

<Response tabs="200">
````json
{
  "integrations": [
    {
      "id": "int_123",
      "name": "slack",
      "status": "active"
    }
  ]
}
````
</Response>
